# 0x330 Experimenting with BASH

# Since so much of hacking is rooted in exploitation and experimentation,
# the ability to quickly try different things is vital.

# The `bash` shell and `perl` are common on most machines and are all that is needed 
# to experiment with exploitation.

# `perl` is an interpreted programming language with a `print` command that
# happens to be particularly suited to generating long sequences of characters.

# And we can use `perl` as like below (page 133).
perl -e 'print "A" x 20;'
#AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

# Any character can also be printed by using `\x##`, where ## is the hexadecimal
# value of the character.
